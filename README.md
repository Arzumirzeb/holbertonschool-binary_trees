## Overview

This repository explores the concepts of binary trees, their properties, and common operations.

## Concepts Covered

**Binary Tree:** A tree-like data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

**Binary Search Tree (BST):** A specialized binary tree where nodes are arranged in a specific order:
- The value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the value of the node itself.
- The value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the value of the node itself.
  
**Time Complexity:** Binary trees, especially BSTs, often offer faster searching and insertion compared to linked lists.

**Depth, Height, and Size:**
- **Depth:** The number of edges from the root node to a given node.
- **Height:** The maximum depth of any node in the tree.
- **Size:** The total number of nodes in the tree.

**Traversal Methods:** Techniques to visit each node in the tree in a specific order:

- **In-Order:** Visit left subtree, root, then right subtree.
- **Pre-Order:** Visit root, left subtree, then right subtree.
- **Post-Order:** Visit left subtree, right subtree, then root.

**Types of Binary Trees:**
- **Complete Binary Tree:** All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

- **Full Binary Tree:** Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

- **Perfect Binary Tree:** A full binary tree where all levels are completely filled.

- **Balanced Binary Tree:** The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1.
